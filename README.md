Ludum Dare #23 - Theme ???
==========================

Tasks the framework/engine should be able to do (EASILY) before the start of LD23:

- ~~preload images~~
- ~~draw image~~
- ~~load tileset, draw tiles from it~~
- animate from tiles in a tileset, specifying rate
- sprite
  - position, velocity
  - collision, events
  - jumping?
  - sprite editor/placement?
- keyboard and mouse
- load and play sound
